It enables machines to perform tasks such as:

Image recognition

Speech recognition

Natural language processing

Autonomous driving

📘 Definition

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple hidden layers to automatically learn representations and patterns from large amounts of data.

Unlike traditional algorithms, deep learning models improve their performance by learning from data.

🎯 Purpose of Deep Learning

Deep learning helps solve problems where traditional programming fails.

Main purposes include:

Pattern recognition

Automated decision making

Feature extraction from raw data

Predictive analysis

Examples:

Face unlock in smartphones

Voice assistants

Chatbots

Medical image diagnosis

📚 Libraries Required

Common Python libraries used in deep learning:

Library	Purpose
NumPy	Numerical operations
Pandas	Data handling
Matplotlib	Data visualization
TensorFlow	Deep learning framework
Keras	High-level neural network API
Scikit-learn	Data preprocessing
Installation
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
🧪 Implementation Steps
1️⃣ Import Libraries
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
2️⃣ Load Dataset
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
3️⃣ Normalize Data
X_train = X_train / 255.0
X_test = X_test / 255.0
4️⃣ Build Model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28,28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
5️⃣ Train Model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
6️⃣ Evaluate Model
model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
🌍 Applications of Deep Learning
